## 🚀 Project Overview

- The project is implemented in **Python**, and includes:  
  - A Jupyter notebook (`Email_Spam.ipynb`) for data exploration / model development.  
  - A script (`email_spam.py`) to run spam classification.  
  - A trained model file (`lr_model.pkl`).  
  - A sample dataset (`mail_data.csv`).  

- Using natural language processing (NLP) + machine learning to build a spam classifier from email data.  

- The system can predict whether a given email is **spam** or **ham (legitimate)**.
